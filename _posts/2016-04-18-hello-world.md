This blog is a long time coming. 

This is a not-so-random collection of musings and memory dumps on on coding,
machine learning and observations on technology. This is a long time time
coming because the articles (yet to be posted) haven't seen the light of the
web, although they are/were deserving of that. 

And what better a publishing platform than github-pages and Jekyll (with tufte-css on top of that)?
