I am Swamy Muddu. I am an engineer and researcher based in SF Bay Area. I am
interested in everything data science, machine and deep learning. My academic
and professional career span chip design, design/semiconductor technology
interface, and machine learning.  


I am passionate about realization of software and hardware systems that can learn. 
My current work focuses on application of machine and deep learning to challenging problems in structured prediction, computer vision and NLP. I also work on speed-up and optimization techniques for training and inference of deep networks. 


In my free time, I participate in [numer.ai](https://numer.ai/) challenge, 
or hack away on my [jetson tx2](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/buy/jetson-tx2), or catch up on latest ML/DL tweets.

I am on twitter [@_smuddu](https://twitter.com/_smuddu)

Occassionally, I post pictures from my cameras to [instagram](https://instagram.com/smuddu) and [vsco](https://vsco.co/smuddu/)
